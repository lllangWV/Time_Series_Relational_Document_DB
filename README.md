# Time Series Relational and Document DB

This repository is dedicated to experimenting and learning about time series databases, relational databases, and document databases. It serves as a playground for exploring different database technologies and their applications in the context of time series data.

## Introduction

In this repository, we aim to understand the concepts and principles behind time series databases, relational databases, and document databases. We will explore their strengths, weaknesses, and use cases, and gain hands-on experience by implementing various examples and projects.

## Technologies

The following technologies will be used in this repository:

- Time series databases: [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/), [TimescaleDB](https://www.timescale.com/)
- Relational databases: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- Document databases: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/)

Feel free to suggest additional technologies or frameworks that you think would be valuable to explore.
